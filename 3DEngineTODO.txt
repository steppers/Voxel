BIG TOPICS:
-Rendering Engine

OTHER TOPICS:
-Some way to insert game into engine
-Better scratchpad support
-Better textures (Reading, blitting, basic image processing)
-Some way to separate game and engine data
-Add higher level rendering constructs (Shaders, Materials, Meshes, transforms)
-Add some form of automatic shader selection
-Add some form of primitives (Rectangles, Spheres, cubes)
-More flexible Transform class (default values for projection and camera)
-Non perspective views (Orthogonal)
-Texture manipulation (Translation, Rotation, Scale)
-More control over textures(Filtering, formatting)
-More friendly constructors
-Camera look limits
-Window should have more properties (Center, Fullscreen, MouseLocking?)
-Better vector math (normalisation, +=, Common Constants, Swizzle support)
-Options class/system, some place to read values that the player chooses
-Centralised "level" or "Scene" class that holds the data the game is using.

VOXEL ENGINE SPECIFIC:
-Rewrite/Optimise (with comments!)
-Voxel Sprites
-Lighting system
-Terrain Generator (3D Perlin, Buildings props, voxel sprites)
-Weapons
-Particles
-GUI (Menus, HUD, crosshair)
-Multiplayer
-Player Meshes
-pickups (voxel sprites)
-Gravity Changing
-Cube level to associate with the Changing gravity.
